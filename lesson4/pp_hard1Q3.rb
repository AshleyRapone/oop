# Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic motorboat.
# A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves similar to a catamaran.
# Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need to specify number of hulls or propellers.
# How would you modify the vehicles code to incorporate a new Motorboat class?
